The DDR5 adapter plank makes it easy to read and write the SPD chip on DDR5 UDIMM and SODIMM computer memory modules. 

Use the Bus Pirate [```ddr5``` command]({{< relref "/docs/devices/ddr5/#ddr5-command">}}) to read and write the SPD EEPROM on a DDR5 module, or follow the [DDR5 device demo]({{< relref "/docs/devices/ddr5/">}}) to learn about the technical details.

DDR5 adapter plank features:
- 288 pin DDR5 UDIMM socket for standard desktop memory modules
- 262 pin DDR5 SODIMM socket for laptop memory modules
- Accepts a single 5 volt power supply
- A 3.3 volt regulator supplies the I2C and PWR_EN pins
- A level shifter ensures the I2C pins HSDA and HSCL are never more than 3.3 volts
- HSA is pulled to ground to put the module in offline mode
- PWR_GOOD is connected to an LED indicator that lights when the PMIC reports a voltage error

The DDR5 plank is ready to use.

When inserting a DDR5 module into the adapter plank, **hold the bottom of the PCB with both hands and press the module firmly into the socket**. The retaining clips should click into place.

## SODIMM and UDIMM Connections

![](/images/docs/demo/ddr5-connection.png)

|DDR5 UDIMM (288 pins)|DDR5 SODIMM (262 pins)|Description|   
|-|-|-|
|HSDA (5)|HSDA (6)|I2C Data (3.3volt) **must be level shifted**|
|HSCL (4)|HSCL (4)|I2C Clock (3.3volt) **must be level shifted**|
|PWR_EN(151)|PWR_EN (8)|Power Enable, connect to 3.3 volts|
|HSA (148)|HSA (2)|Host Sideband Address, connect to ground for address 0 (Offline Mode)|
|PWR_GOOD (147)|PWR_GOOD (7)|Power Good, optional (low for error)|
|BULK_VIN (3)|BULK_VIN (1)|Bulk Voltage Input, connect to 5 volts|
|GND (150)|GND(9)|Ground|

We only need to connect a few pins to access the SPD hub on a DDR5 module. The rest of the pins are used for power, data, and control signals.

- **HSDA** and **HSCL** are the I2C data and clock pins. While the DDR5 module is powered by 5 volts, the I2C pins must be no more than 3.3 volts. Use a level shifter to connect these pins if needed. 
- **HSA** sets the SPD and PMIC I2C address. Motherboards accept multiple DDR5 modules, so each module needs a unique I2C address. A pull-down resistor connected to the HSA pin sets the last four bits of the base I2C address (0x50). When HSA is connected to ground the module goes into a special *offline service mode* that allows us to change write protected portions of the EEPROM. 
- **PWR_EN** enables the DDR5 module power supply when connected to 3.3 volts.
- **PWR_GOOD** is an open drain output signal from the PMIC. If the power is stable this pin will float, but if the supply is interrupted it will pull low. This might be useful for diagnosing a faulty DDR5 module power supply.
- **BULK_VIN** is the single 5 volt power supply for the SDP hub and PMIC. There are multiple BULK_VIN pins on a DDR5 module, but only one needs to be connected to access the SPD hub. 
- **GND** is the ground pin. There are multiple GND pins on a DDR5 module, but only one needs to be connected to access the SPD hub.

## Warning and Disclaimer

**Use the DDR5 adapter at your own risk.** Don't experiment with expensive high capacity, high speed, overclocker-special DDR5. We picked up cheap 8GB sticks from an e-Waste recycler, and we don't care if they get damaged.
