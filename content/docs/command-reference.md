The Bus Pirate is a versatile debugging and development tool for working with various communication protocols like I2C, SPI, UART, and more. It acts as a bridge between a computer and embedded devices, allowing users to talk to chips without writing code. It is especially useful for prototyping, testing, and reverse engineering hardware.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
It's always best to use the [latest firmware]({{< relref "/docs/downloads" >}}). There are continuous improvements and new features. See the [upgrade guide]({{< relref "/docs/tutorial-basics/firmware-update/" >}}) for the simple drag and drop update process.

## User terminal

![](/images/docs/fw/cmd-toolbar.png)

Connect to the Bus Pirate command line with your [favorite serial terminal software]({{< relref "/docs/tutorial-basics/quick-setup/" >}}). On Windows we like the latest version of [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

{{% alert context="info" %}}
Talk to the Bus Pirate from a serial terminal of your choice. The serial port is emulated over USB, so the serial port speed setting should not matter. It is traditional to use "115200bps, 8/N/1" if you need configure your terminal, but it should not actually matter.

### VT100 terminal emulation
{{< term "Bus Pirate [/dev/ttyS0]" >}}
VT100 compatible color mode? (Y/n)>
{{< /term >}}

Press ```enter``` to show the command prompt if your terminal is blank. 

If the Bus Pirate has just restarted you will be prompted to choose the terminal emulation mode.
- VT100 mode - Supports color and a live view statusbar at the bottom of the terminal. This should be your first choice unless you specifically need the legacy ASCII mode.
- ASCII mode - Legacy monochrome text only mode.

The terminal mode can be changed from the [configuration menu]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#c-configuration-options-menu">}}). Open the configuration menu with the ```c``` command followed by ```enter```. 

{{% alert context="info" %}}
If you choose VT100 mode and see lots of garbage characters in the terminal, check that your terminal emulator has VT100 support and that VT100 support is enabled.

### Command line
{{< term "Bus Pirate [/dev/ttyS0]" >}}
<span style="color:#96cb59">HiZ></span> 
{{< /term >}}

The Bus Pirate has a simple Linux-like command line interface. Enter a command followed by optional parameters and then press ```enter``` to execute.

### HiZ mode
The Bus Pirate always starts in high impedance mode (HiZ), a safe mode with all outputs disabled. HiZ mode intends to protect any connected devices from conditions beyond their specifications. From the HiZ prompt, a bus mode can be selected to use a specific protocol with the ```m``` [mode command]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#m-set-bus-mode" >}}).

## Utilities

|Command|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|```w```/```W``` | Power supply (off/ON)
|```v```/```V``` | Power supply voltage report (once/CONTINUOUS)
|```p```/```P``` | Pull-up resistors (off/ON)
|```g```/```G``` | Frequency generator (off/ON)
|```f```/```F``` | Measure frequency (once/CONTINUOUS)
|```=```X | Convert X to HEX/DEC/BIN number format
|```\|``` X | Reverse bits in byte X
|```a```/```A```/```@``` | Auxiliary pin control (low/HIGH/input)


### ```w/W``` Power supply (off/ON) 
{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-psuon-menu.html" >}} 

A 'Programmable Power Supply Unit' (PPSU) has several handy features:
- 1-5volts adjustable output
- 0-500mA current sense 
- 0-500mA current limit with digital fuse
- One-way valve to protect the PPSU when an external voltage is applied to the VREF/VOUT pin

Uppercase ```W``` enables the onboard power supply unit. You will be prompted for the output voltage and an optional current limit. Default current limit is 300mA, or 0 for no current limit. 

- ```W``` - Enable the power supply unit. Show interactive menu to set voltage and current limit.
- ```W <voltage> <current limit>``` - Enable the power supply unit with voltage and current limit specified. 
- ```W <voltage>``` - Enable the power supply unit with voltage specified. Current limit is set to 300mA.
- ```w``` - Disable the power supply unit.

Check the voltage and current in the live view statusbar if active, or show the power supply voltage report using the ```v``` command.

When the programmed current limit is exceeded the PPSU hardware fuse disables the power supply. The terminal colors invert repeatedly, an alarm bell will sound, an error message is shown and command execution is halted. Use the ```W``` command to restart the PPSU again.

{{% alert context="danger" %}}
400mA is the rated maximum of the PPSU, but we added some headroom in the current limit to account for current spikes.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert context="info" %}}
The PPSU is capable of 0.8 to 5volts output. However, the maximum working range is limited to 1-5volts because of the maximum Vgs of the P-channel MOSFET in the one-way valve. Many will be capable of the full range, but some may not. The Bus Pirate IO buffers are only rated to 1.65volts, so in practice this isn't an issue over the specified working range.
{{% /alert %}}



{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-psuon-short.html" >}} 

- ```W <voltage> <current limit>``` - Set the voltage and current limit. The voltage is in volts, the current limit is in mA. The current limit is optional, if not specified the default is 300mA, or use 0 for no current limit.

{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-psuoff.html" >}} 

Lowercase ```w``` disables the PPSU.
- ```w``` - Disable the power supply.

### ```v/V``` Power supply voltage report 

![](/images/docs/fw/psu-statusbar1a.png) 

The voltage report shows the current state of all the Bus Pirate pins and peripherals. This is a duplicate of the information shown on the live view statusbar.

- ```v``` - Show the power supply voltage report once.
- ```V``` - Show the power supply voltage report, update continuously. Press any key to exit.

### ```p/P``` Pull-up resistors 

{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-p.html" >}}

```p``` and ```P``` toggle the pull-up resistors off and on. Pull-up resistors are required for open collector/open drain bus types such as 1-Wire and I2C.

- ```P``` - Enable the pull-up resistors.
- ```p``` - Disable the pull-up resistors.

The onboard pull-up resistors **are powered through the VREF/VOUT pin of the IO header**, either by the onboard power supply or an external voltage applied to the VREF/VOUT pin. 

{{% alert context="info" %}}
A warning is displayed if there's no voltage on the VREF/VOUT pin. Check the status bar or voltage report ```v``` to verify that a voltage is present on VOUT/VREF.
{{% /alert %}}

### ```g/G``` Frequency generator

{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-pwmon.html" >}} 

Uppercase ```G``` displays the frequency generation menu. Choose an available pin and enter the period or frequency, including the units (ns, us, ms, Hz, KHz or Mhz). Enter a duty cycle as a percent, don't forget the ```%```. The Bus Pirate will find the closest match and generate a frequency on the pin. 

- ```G``` - show the frequency generation menu.
- ```g``` - disable frequency generator, show menu if multiple frequency generators are active.
- ```g <pin>``` - disable frequency generator on \<pin>.

![](/images/docs/fw/cmd-freq.png)

The frequency generator will be displayed in the live view statusbar and on the LCD with the label ***PWM***.

{{% alert context="danger" %}}
Not all pins will be available due to the PWM structure of the Raspberry Pi chip used in the Bus Pirate, and adjacent pairs must share the same frequency. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-pwmalloff.html" >}} 

- ```g``` - disable frequency generator, show menu if multiple frequency generators are active.

Erase the internal flash storage and format it with a FAT16 file system. **ALL DATA WILL BE LOST!**
- ```format``` - format the entire flash storage, confirm twice. This will erase all files and directories on the disk.

### ```dump``` Dump read data to file
{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-dump.html" >}}

- ```dump <bytes> <file>``` - read data using the current mode [```r``` bus command]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#r-read-byte">}}) and save it to a file.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
```dump``` is the equivalent of using the ```r``` command to read data from a device, but instead of displaying the data on the terminal, it saves it to a file.
{{% /alert %}}

This command is useful when you want to save data from a device to a file. While the Bus Pirate has commands to dump many chips, the ```dump``` command is a generic read command that can be used with any device.

First, manually send the commands to put the target device in read mode. Then use the ```dump``` command to read the data and save it to a file. 

### ```image``` Display bitmap image on LCD
{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-image.html" >}}

- ```image <file>``` - shows the header info from ANY recognized BMP format (v1/2/3)
- ```image <file> -d``` - draw the file content on the LCD. Checks if the file is the correct height/width and a supported pixel format (16bits/565, or 24bit/888)

Load a bitmap image file and display it on the LCD. The Bus Pirate supports BMP format images. The image must be 128x64 pixels in size, and the pixel format must be 16bits/565 or 24bit/888.

A simple bus commands are used to interact with devices in various protocols. Bus command characters have the same general function in each bus mode, such as ```r``` to read a byte of data.

This example sends a bus start, the value 0x31, and then reads 5
bytes, followed by bus stop. Up to 255 characters may be
entered into the Bus Pirate terminal at once, press ```enter``` to execute the
commands.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
**Bus commands must start with ```[```, ```{```, or ```>```.**

{{< /term >}}

START commands generate a START condition (I2C), a RESET (1-Wire, LED), chip select (SPI) and have similar START type functions in most modes. A line beginning with START is interpreted as bus commands.

- ```[``` - send the START condition for the currently selected bus mode.
- ```{``` - send the alternate START condition for the currently selected bus mode.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
Lines beginning with ```[``` and ```{``` are interpreted as bus commands, data will be sent to the device in the current protocol selected with the [```m``` command]({{% relref "/docs/command-reference/#m-set-bus-mode" %}}).

[Binary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system) values are
commonly used in electronics because the 1s and 0s correspond to
register 'switches' that control various aspects of a device. When used as part of a bus command, the Bus Pirate will write the value in the currently selected bus protocol.

Begin a binary number with ```0b```, followed by the bits. Padding 0's are not required,
0b00000001=0b1. Can be used with the [repeat command]({{% relref "/docs/command-reference/#-repeat-eg-r10" %}}) (0b110:1...255) for bulk writes.  

- ```0b0``` - binary "0".
- ```0b1``` - binary "1".

The ```scan``` command searches for I2C device addresses.

You can find the [I2C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) address
for most I2C-compatible chips in the datasheet. But what if you're
working with an unknown chip, a dated chip with no datasheet or you're
just too lazy to look it up?

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/cmdref-mode-i2c-scan-help.html" >}}

The Bus Pirate has a built-in address scanner that checks every possible I2C address for a
response. This brute force method is a fast and easy way to see if any
chips are responding, and to uncover undocumented access addresses.

I2C chips respond to a 7bit address, so up to 128 devices can share the
same two communication wires. An additional bit of the address
determines if the operation is a write to the chip (0), or a read from
the chip (1).

#### Scanner details

The ```scan``` command in I2C mode runs the address scanner.

-   For I2C write addresses: the BP sends a start, the write address,
    looks for an ACK, then sends a stop.
-   For I2C read addresses: the BP sends a start, the read address,
    looks for an ACK. If there is an ACK, it reads a byte and NACKs it.
    Finally it sends a stop.

When the I2C chip responds to the read address, it outputs data and will
miss a stop condition sent immediately after the read address (bus
contention). If the I2C chip misses the stop condition, the address
scanner will see ghost addresses until the read ends randomly. By
reading a byte after any read address that ACKs, we have a chance to
NACK the read and properly end the I2C transaction.

## ACK/NACK management

These examples read and write from the RAM of a DS1307 RTC chip.
```
I2C> [0xd1 rrrr]
I2C START CONDITION
WRITE: 0xD1 GOT ACK: YES**<<<read address** 
READ: 0×07 ACK **<<<sent ACK*[ 
READ: 0x06 ACK 
READ: 0x05 ACK 
READ: 0x04 NACK **<<<last read before STOP, sent NACK** 
I2C STOP CONDITION 
I2C>
```
I2C read operations must be ACKed
or NACKed by the host (the Bus Pirate). The Bus Pirate automates this,
but you should know a few rules about how it works.

The I2C library doesn't ACK/NACK a read operation until the following
command. If the next command is a STOP (or START) the Bus Pirate sends a
NACK bit. On all other commands it sends an ACK bit. The terminal output
displays the (N)ACK status. 
```
I2C> [0xd1 r:5] 
I2C START CONDITION
WRITE: 0xD1 GOT ACK: YES 
BULK READ 0×05 BYTES: 
0×07 ACK 0×06 ACK 0×05 ACK 0×04 ACK 0×03 NACK 
I2C STOP CONDITION 
I2C> 
```
Nothing changes for write commands because the slave ACKs to the Bus Pirate during
writes. Here’s an example using the bulk read command (r:5).
```
I2C>[0xd1 r **<<<setup and read one byte** 
I2C START CONDITION 
WRITE: 0xD1 GOT ACK: YES 
READ: 0x07 *(N)ACK PENDING **<<<no ACK sent yet** 
I2C>r**<<<read another byte** 
ACK**<<<ACK for previous byte** 
READ: 0x06 *(N)ACK PENDING**<<<no ACK yet** 
I2C>] **<<<STOP command** 
NACK **<<<next command is STOP, so NACK** 
I2C STOP CONDITION 
I2C> 
```
A consequence of the
delayed ACK/NACK system is that partial transactions will leave read
operations incomplete.

Here, we setup a read operation ([0xd1) and read a byte (r). Since the
Bus Pirate has no way of knowing if the next operation will be another
read (r) or a stop condition (]), it leaves the ninth bit hanging. The
warning “*(N)ACK PENDING” alerts you to this state.

Our next command is another read (r), so the Bus Pirate ACKs the
previous read and gets another byte. Again, it leaves the (N)ACK bit
pending until the next command.

The final command is STOP (]). The Bus Pirate ends the read with a NACK
and then sends the stop condition.

### Pull-up resistors

2-Wire is an open-collector bus, it requires pull-up resistors to hold the
clock and data lines high and create the data '1'. In 2-Wire mode, the Bus Pirate doesn't
output high, it only pulls low. Without pull-up resistors there can
never be a '1'. 

Enable the Bus Pirate onboard pull-up resistors with the [```P``` command]({{% relref "/docs/command-reference/#pp-pull-up-resistors" %}}).
