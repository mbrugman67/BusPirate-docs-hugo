The Bus Pirate is a versatile debugging and development tool for working with various communication protocols like I2C, SPI, UART, and more. It acts as a bridge between a computer and embedded devices, allowing users to talk to chips without writing code. It is especially useful for prototyping, testing, and reverse engineering hardware.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
It's always best to use the [latest firmware]({{< relref "/docs/downloads" >}}). There are continuous improvements and new features. See the [upgrade guide]({{< relref "/docs/tutorial-basics/firmware-update/" >}}) for the simple drag and drop update process.

## User terminal

<!-- ![](/images/docs/fw/cmd-toolbar.png)-->

{{< asciicast src="/sizzle/sizzle-cast.json" poster="npt:1:23"  idleTimeLimit=2 >}}

Connect to the Bus Pirate command line with your [favorite serial terminal software]({{< relref "/docs/tutorial-basics/quick-setup/" >}}). On Windows we like the latest version of [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

{{% alert context="info" %}}
Talk to the Bus Pirate from a serial terminal of your choice. The serial port is emulated over USB, so the serial port speed setting should not matter. It is traditional to use "115200bps, 8/N/1" if you need configure your terminal, but it should not actually matter.

### VT100 terminal emulation
{{< term "Bus Pirate [/dev/ttyS0]" >}}
VT100 compatible color mode? (Y/n)>
{{< /term >}}

Press ```enter``` to show the command prompt if your terminal is blank. 

If the Bus Pirate has just restarted you will be prompted to choose the terminal emulation mode.
- VT100 mode - Supports color and a live view statusbar at the bottom of the terminal. This should be your first choice unless you specifically need the legacy ASCII mode.
- ASCII mode - Legacy monochrome text only mode.

The terminal mode can be changed from the [configuration menu]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#c-configuration-options-menu">}}). Open the configuration menu with the ```c``` command followed by ```enter```. 

{{% alert context="info" %}}
If you choose VT100 mode and see lots of garbage characters in the terminal, check that your terminal emulator has VT100 support and that VT100 support is enabled.

### Command line
{{< term "Bus Pirate [/dev/ttyS0]" >}}
<span style="color:#96cb59">HiZ></span> 
{{< /term >}}

The Bus Pirate has a simple Linux-like command line interface. Enter a command followed by optional parameters and then press ```enter``` to execute.

### HiZ mode
The Bus Pirate always starts in high impedance mode (HiZ), a safe mode with all outputs disabled. HiZ mode intends to protect any connected devices from conditions beyond their specifications. From the HiZ prompt, a bus mode can be selected to use a specific protocol with the ```m``` [mode command]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#m-set-bus-mode" >}}).

## Utilities

|Command|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|```w```/```W``` | Power supply (off/ON)
|```v```/```V``` | Power supply voltage report (once/CONTINUOUS)
|```p```/```P``` | Pull-up resistors (off/ON)
|```g```/```G``` | Frequency generator (off/ON)
|```f```/```F``` | Measure frequency (once/CONTINUOUS)
|```=```X | Convert X to HEX/DEC/BIN number format
|```\|``` X | Reverse bits in byte X
|```a```/```A```/```@``` | Auxiliary pin control (low/HIGH/input)


### ```w/W``` Power supply (off/ON) 
{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-psuon-menu.html" >}} 

A 'Programmable Power Supply Unit' (PPSU) has several handy features:
- 1-5volts adjustable output
- 0-500mA current sense 
- 0-500mA current limit with digital fuse
- One-way valve to protect the PPSU when an external voltage is applied to the VREF/VOUT pin

Uppercase ```W``` enables the onboard power supply unit. You will be prompted for the output voltage and an optional current limit. Default current limit is 300mA, or 0 for no current limit. 

- ```W``` - Enable the power supply unit. Show interactive menu to set voltage and current limit.
- ```W <voltage> <current limit>``` - Enable the power supply unit with voltage and current limit specified. 
- ```W <voltage>``` - Enable the power supply unit with voltage specified. Current limit is set to 300mA.
- ```w``` - Disable the power supply unit.

Check the voltage and current in the live view statusbar if active, or show the power supply voltage report using the ```v``` command.

When the programmed current limit is exceeded the PPSU hardware fuse disables the power supply. The terminal colors invert repeatedly, an alarm bell will sound, an error message is shown and command execution is halted. Use the ```W``` command to restart the PPSU again.

{{% alert context="danger" %}}
300mA is the rated maximum of the PPSU, but we added some headroom in the current limit to account for current spikes.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert context="info" %}}
The PPSU is capable of 0.8 to 5volts output. However, the maximum working range is limited to 1-5volts because of the maximum Vgs of the P-channel MOSFET in the one-way valve. Many will be capable of the full range, but some may not. The Bus Pirate IO buffers are only rated to 1.65volts, so in practice this isn't an issue over the specified working range.
{{% /alert %}}



{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-psuon-short.html" >}} 

- ```W <voltage> <current limit>``` - Set the voltage and current limit. The voltage is in volts, the current limit is in mA. The current limit is optional, if not specified the default is 300mA, or use 0 for no current limit.

{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-psuoff.html" >}} 

Lowercase ```w``` disables the PPSU.
- ```w``` - Disable the power supply.

### ```v/V``` Power supply voltage report 

![](/images/docs/fw/psu-statusbar1a.png) 

The voltage report shows the current state of all the Bus Pirate pins and peripherals. This is a duplicate of the information shown on the live view statusbar.

- ```v``` - Show the power supply voltage report once.
- ```V``` - Show the power supply voltage report, update continuously. Press any key to exit.

### ```p/P``` Pull-up resistors 

{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-p.html" >}}

```p``` and ```P``` toggle the pull-up resistors off and on. Pull-up resistors are required for open collector/open drain bus types such as 1-Wire and I2C.

- ```P``` - Enable the pull-up resistors.
- ```p``` - Disable the pull-up resistors.

The onboard pull-up resistors **are powered through the VREF/VOUT pin of the IO header**, either by the onboard power supply or an external voltage applied to the VREF/VOUT pin. 

{{% alert context="info" %}}
A warning is displayed if there's no voltage on the VREF/VOUT pin. Check the status bar or voltage report ```v``` to verify that a voltage is present on VOUT/VREF.
{{% /alert %}}

### ```g/G``` Frequency generator

{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-pwmon.html" >}} 

Uppercase ```G``` displays the frequency generation menu. Choose an available pin and enter the period or frequency, including the units (ns, us, ms, Hz, KHz or Mhz). Enter a duty cycle as a percent, don't forget the ```%```. The Bus Pirate will find the closest match and generate a frequency on the pin. 

- ```G``` - show the frequency generation menu.
- ```g``` - disable frequency generator, show menu if multiple frequency generators are active.
- ```g <pin>``` - disable frequency generator on \<pin>.

![](/images/docs/fw/cmd-freq.png)

The frequency generator will be displayed in the live view statusbar and on the LCD with the label ***PWM***.

{{% alert context="danger" %}}
Not all pins will be available due to the PWM structure of the Raspberry Pi chip used in the Bus Pirate, and adjacent pairs must share the same frequency. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-pwmalloff.html" >}} 

- ```g``` - disable frequency generator, show menu if multiple frequency generators are active.

### ```dump``` Dump read data to file
{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-dump.html" >}}

- ```dump <bytes> <file>``` - read data using the current mode [```r``` bus command]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#r-read-byte">}}) and save it to a file.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
```dump``` is the equivalent of using the ```r``` command to read data from a device, but instead of displaying the data on the terminal, it saves it to a file.
{{% /alert %}}

This command is useful when you want to save data from a device to a file. While the Bus Pirate has commands to dump many chips, the ```dump``` command is a generic read command that can be used with any device.

First, manually send the commands to put the target device in read mode. Then use the ```dump``` command to read the data and save it to a file. 

### ```image``` Display bitmap image on LCD
{{< termfile  source="static/snippets/cmdref-image.html" >}}

- ```image <file>``` - shows the header info from ANY recognized BMP format (v1/2/3)
- ```image <file> -d``` - draw the file content on the LCD. Checks if the file is the correct height/width and a supported pixel format (16bits/565, or 24bit/888)

Load a bitmap image file and display it on the LCD. The Bus Pirate supports BMP format images. The image must be 128x64 pixels in size, and the pixel format must be 16bits/565 or 24bit/888.

A simple bus commands are used to interact with devices in various protocols. Bus command characters have the same general function in each bus mode, such as ```r``` to read a byte of data.

This example sends a bus start, the value 0x31, and then reads 5
bytes, followed by bus stop. Up to 255 characters may be
entered into the Bus Pirate terminal at once, press ```enter``` to execute the
commands.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
**Bus commands must start with ```[```, ```{```, or ```>```.**
{{% /alert %}}

### ```[ or {``` Bus START condition

<span style="color:#bfa530">CS Select (0)</span>
<span style="color:#96cb59">SPI></span>
{{< /term >}}

START commands generate a START condition (I2C), a RESET (1-Wire, LED), chip select (SPI) and have similar START type functions in most modes. A line beginning with START is interpreted as bus commands. 

- ```[``` - send the START condition for the currently selected bus mode.
- ```{``` - send the alternate START condition for the currently selected bus mode.

Check the protocol documentation below to see what START and alternate START do in each mode. [In SPI mode]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#bus-commands-5">}}), for example, ```[``` selects a chip, while ```{``` selects the chip and displays each byte received when data is written (write with read mode).

{{% alert context="info" %}}
Lines beginning with ```[``` and ```{``` are interpreted as bus commands, data will be sent to the device in the current protocol selected with the [```m``` command]({{% relref "/docs/command-reference/#m-set-bus-mode" %}}).
{{% /alert %}}

[Binary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system) values are
commonly used in electronics because the 1s and 0s correspond to
register 'switches' that control various aspects of a device. When used as part of a bus command, the Bus Pirate will write the value in the currently selected bus protocol.

Begin a binary number with ```0b```, followed by the bits. Padding 0's are not required,
0b00000001=0b1. Can be used with the [repeat command]({{% relref "/docs/command-reference/#-repeat-eg-r10" %}}) (0b110:1...255) for bulk writes.  

- ```0b0``` - binary "0".
- ```0b1``` - binary "1".

[Hexadecimal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) values are base
16 numbers that use a-f for the numbers 10-15, this format is very
common in computers and electronics. When used as part of a bus command, the Bus Pirate will write the value in the currently selected bus protocol.

Begin a hexadecimal number with ```0x``` or ```0h```, followed by the hex digits. A-F can be lowercase or uppercase letters. Padding 0's are not required, 0x05=0x5. Hexadecimal numbers can be used with the [repeat command]({{% relref "/docs/command-reference/#-repeat-eg-r10" %}}) (0xff:1...255) for bulk writes.

- ```0x0``` - hexadecimal "0".

Sometimes it's useful to control IO pins directly when executing bus commands.

- ```a.<pin>``` - set \<pin> low (0V).
- ```A.<pin>``` - set \<pin> high (VCC).
- ```@.<pin>``` - set \<pin> to input (HiZ) and read the pin state. The pin state is reported as 0 or 1.

{{% alert context="warning" %}}
Pins already assigned a function, such as PWM or mode/protocol pins, cannot be changed with the a/A/@ commands. The Bus Pirate will report an error.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert context="info" %}}
Bus commands a/A/@ use the ```a.<pin>``` notation, the syntax is followed by a **.** and the pin number to control. This is different than the commands a/A/@, which are followed by a space and the pin number to control.

1-Wire is a single wire bus for low speed interfaces.

### Pull-up resistors

1-Wire is an open-collector bus, it requires pull-up resistors to hold the
data line high and create the data '1'. 1-Wire parts don't
output high, they only pull low. Without pull-up resistors there can
never be a '1'. 

Enable the Bus Pirate onboard pull-up resistors with the [```P``` command]({{% relref "/docs/command-reference/#pp-pull-up-resistors"%}}).

### ```eeprom``` Read, write, erase, verify, test, dump 1-Wire EEPROMs


{{< asciicast src="/screencast/1wire-eeprom-command-cast.json" poster="npt:0:43"  idleTimeLimit=2 >}}
<br/>
```eeprom``` is a command to read, write, erase, verify, test and dump common GX/DS243x 1-Wire EEPROMs. 


#### 1-Wire EEPROM list supported devices

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/1wire-eeprom-command-list.html" >}}

- ```eeprom list``` - list all EEPROM devices supported by the ```eeprom``` command

{{% alert context="info" %}}
There are only two widely used 1-Wire EEPROM: DS2431+ (1Kbit) and DS24B33 (4Kbit). There is also a clone of the DS2431+ called GX3421.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert context="danger" %}}
The ```eeprom``` command uses the "skip ROM" method to access the EEPROM. This means that only one EEPROM can be connected to the 1-Wire bus at a time. If you have multiple EEPROMs, you must disconnect all but one before using the ```eeprom``` command.
{{% /alert %}}

##### Chip voltage requirements

|Family|Minimum Voltage|Maximum Voltage|
|---|---|---|---|
|DS243X|2.8V|5.25V|


Before using the ```eeprom``` command, you'll need to enable a power supply with the [```W``` command]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#ww-power-supply-offon">}}) and pull-up resistors with the [```P``` command]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#pp-pull-up-resistors">}}).

{{% alert context="danger" %}}
**1-Wire EEPROMs are powered from the bus data line, not a supply pin.** If EEPROM writes fail you may need to add a 2K or smaller pull-up resistor between a power supply (VOUT) and the 1-Wire data pin.
{{% /alert %}}

#### 1-Wire EEPROM dump to terminal

**I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** is a 2-wire protocol used for communication between devices. It uses two lines: **SDA** (data) and **SCL** (clock). The protocol supports multiple devices on the same bus, with each device identified by a unique 7-bit address.

#### **Start and Stop Conditions**
   - ```S``` - Each transaction begins with a **start condition** by pulling SDA low while SCL remains high.
   - ```P``` - Each transaction ends with a **stop condition** by releasing SDA high while SCL remains high.
   - ```Sr``` - A **repeat start condition** starts a new transaction with the same device, without sending a stop condition. It can be replaced with a stop condition followed by a start condition, but the repeat start is more efficient.

#### **Byte Transmission**
   - Data is transmitted 8 bits at a time, starting with the most significant bit (MSB).
   - ```A```/```N``` - After each byte there is a 9th **ACK**/**NACK** bit. The receiver sends an **ACK** (acknowledge) by pulling SDA low or a **NACK** (not acknowledge) by leaving SDA high. NACK is typically used to tell a chip that we are done reading data from it. 

#### **Addressing**
   - The first byte sent after a start condition contains the 7-bit device address and a **read/write bit**. In the logic analyzer trace the 7-bit address is 0b1010000 (0x50).
     - ```W``` - `0` for write operations (0b1010000`0` = 0xA0).
     - ```R``` - `1` for read operations (0b1010000`1` = 0xA1).

#### **Bus Pirate I2C syntax**

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/cmdref-i2c-example.html" >}}

{{% alert context="info" %}}
```[0xA0 0x00 [0xA1 r]``` is the Bus Pirate syntax for the I2C example above.
{{% /alert %}}

- ```[``` - I2C start condition
- ```0xA0``` - Write the device address `0xA0`, which is the 7-bit address `0x50` with the write/read bit cleared (0).
- ```0x00``` - Write the command `0x00`, which is often used to select a register or address.
- ```[``` - I2C repeat start condition.
- ```0xA1``` - Write the device address `0xA1`, which is the 7-bit address `0x50` with the write/read bit set (1).
- ```r``` - Read one byte from SDA, which will be the data from the device.
- ```]``` - I2C stop condition.


### Configuration options

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/cmdref-mode-i2c-config.html" >}}

### Pull-up resistors

I2C is an open-collector bus, it requires pull-up resistors to hold the
clock and data lines high and create the data '1'. I2C parts don't
output high, they only pull low, without pull-up resistors there can
never be a '1'. This will cause common errors such as the I2C address
scanner reporting a response at every address. 

Enable the Bus Pirate onboard pull-up resistors with the [```P``` command]({{% relref "/docs/command-reference/#pp-pull-up-resistors" %}}).

{{< /term >}}

The ```scan``` command searches for I2C device addresses.

You can find the [I2C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) address
for most I2C-compatible chips in the datasheet. But what if you're
working with an unknown chip, a dated chip with no datasheet or you're
just too lazy to look it up?

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/cmdref-mode-i2c-scan-help.html" >}}

The Bus Pirate has a built-in address scanner that checks every possible I2C address for a
response. This brute force method is a fast and easy way to see if any
chips are responding, and to uncover undocumented access addresses.

I2C chips respond to a 7bit address, so up to 128 devices can share the
same two communication wires. An additional bit of the address
determines if the operation is a write to the chip (0), or a read from
the chip (1).

#### Scanner details

The ```scan``` command in I2C mode runs the address scanner.

-   For I2C write addresses: the BP sends a start, the write address,
    looks for an ACK, then sends a stop.
-   For I2C read addresses: the BP sends a start, the read address,
    looks for an ACK. If there is an ACK, it reads a byte and NACKs it.
    Finally it sends a stop.

When the I2C chip responds to the read address, it outputs data and will
miss a stop condition sent immediately after the read address (bus
contention). If the I2C chip misses the stop condition, the address
scanner will see ghost addresses until the read ends randomly. By
reading a byte after any read address that ACKs, we have a chance to
NACK the read and properly end the I2C transaction.

24x chips have a variety of part numbers, but tend to operate in the same way. Often a manufacturer specific part number indicates a different voltage range or upgraded features. AT24C, 24C, 24LC, 24AA, 24FC are all generally part of same basic 24x family of chips. 
{{% /alert %}}  

{{% alert context="danger" %}}
The default I2C address for most 24x chips is 0x50, but many have pins for setting a different address. The ```eeprom``` command uses 0x50 by default, but you can specify a different I2C address with the ```-a``` flag.

```ddr5 probe``` identifies the DDR5 SPD chip and displays its type, revision, vendor ID, and write protection status. It also reads the JEDEC manufacturing information blocks to display stored information about the memory configure and manufacturer. 

The probe command also searches the Manufacture Specific Data block and End User Programmable blocks for hidden information. This will discover EXPO (AMD) and XMP (Intel) overclock profiles, as well as hidden information that unscrupulous manufacturers use to lock equipment to proprietary RAM modules.

#### DDR5 dump
{{< termfile source="static/snippets/ddr5-command-dump-partial.html" >}}

The ```ddr5 dump``` command displays the contents of a DDR5 SPD chip EEPROM/non-volatile memory in the terminal. It reads the chip and prints the contents of each 64-byte block.
- ```ddr5 dump``` - display the contents of the DDR5 SPD chip in the terminal
- ```ddr5 dump -s <start>``` - display the contents of the DDR5 SPD chip, starting at address `<start>`
- ```ddr5 dump -s <start> -b <bytes>``` - display a specific range of bytes, starting at address `<start>` and reading `<bytes>` bytes

#### DDR5 read to file

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/ddr5-command-read.html" >}}

Read the contents of a DDR5 SPD chip and save to a file with the ```ddr5 read``` command. The file name is specified with the ```-f``` flag.
- ```ddr5 read -f <file>``` - read the contents of the DDR5 SPD chip to file `<file>`

#### DDR5 verify against file

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/ddr5-command-verify.html" >}}

Verify the contents of a DDR5 SPD chip against a file with the ```ddr5 verify``` command. The file name is specified with the ```-f``` flag. This command reads the chip and compares it to the file, reporting the location of any differences.

- ```ddr5 verify -f <file>``` - verify the contents of the DDR5 SPD chip against the file `<file>`

#### DDR5 write from file

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/ddr5-command-write.html" >}}

## ACK/NACK management

These examples read and write from the RAM of a DS1307 RTC chip.
```
I2C> [0xd1 rrrr]
I2C START CONDITION
WRITE: 0xD1 GOT ACK: YES**<<<read address** 
READ: 0×07 ACK **<<<sent ACK*[ 
READ: 0x06 ACK 
READ: 0x05 ACK 
READ: 0x04 NACK **<<<last read before STOP, sent NACK** 
I2C STOP CONDITION 
I2C>
```
I2C read operations must be ACKed
or NACKed by the host (the Bus Pirate). The Bus Pirate automates this,
but you should know a few rules about how it works.

The I2C library doesn't ACK/NACK a read operation until the following
command. If the next command is a STOP (or START) the Bus Pirate sends a
NACK bit. On all other commands it sends an ACK bit. The terminal output
displays the (N)ACK status. 
```
I2C> [0xd1 r:5] 
I2C START CONDITION
WRITE: 0xD1 GOT ACK: YES 
BULK READ 0×05 BYTES: 
0×07 ACK 0×06 ACK 0×05 ACK 0×04 ACK 0×03 NACK 
I2C STOP CONDITION 
I2C> 
```
Nothing changes for write commands because the slave ACKs to the Bus Pirate during
writes. Here’s an example using the bulk read command (r:5).
```
I2C>[0xd1 r **<<<setup and read one byte** 
I2C START CONDITION 
WRITE: 0xD1 GOT ACK: YES 
READ: 0x07 *(N)ACK PENDING **<<<no ACK sent yet** 
I2C>r**<<<read another byte** 
ACK**<<<ACK for previous byte** 
READ: 0x06 *(N)ACK PENDING**<<<no ACK yet** 
I2C>] **<<<STOP command** 
NACK **<<<next command is STOP, so NACK** 
I2C STOP CONDITION 
I2C> 
```
A consequence of the
delayed ACK/NACK system is that partial transactions will leave read
operations incomplete.

Here, we setup a read operation ([0xd1) and read a byte (r). Since the
Bus Pirate has no way of knowing if the next operation will be another
read (r) or a stop condition (]), it leaves the ninth bit hanging. The
warning “*(N)ACK PENDING” alerts you to this state.

Our next command is another read (r), so the Bus Pirate ACKs the
previous read and gets another byte. Again, it leaves the (N)ACK bit
pending until the next command.

The final command is STOP (]). The Bus Pirate ends the read with a NACK
and then sends the stop condition.

## SPI

-   **Bus:** [SPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus) (serial peripheral interface)
-   **Connections:** four data pins (MOSI/MISO/CLOCK/CHIP_SELECT) and ground
-   **Output type:** push-pull (1.65-5volts)
-   **Maximum voltage:** 5volts

{{% alert context="info" %}}
SPI is a common 4 wire full duplex protocol. Separate connections for data-in and data-out allow communication to and from the controller at the same time. Multiple sub devices can share the bus, but each will need an individual Chip Select (CS) connection. Chip Select is generally active when low.
{{% /alert %}} 

{{% alert context="warning" %}}
Looking for something like SPI, but with individual control over the clock and data pins? Check out [3WIRE]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#3-wire">}}) and [2WIRE]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#2-wire">}}) mode.

### SPI Protocol Overview

![alt text](/images/docs/command-reference/image-4.png)

**SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)** is a synchronous serial communication protocol commonly used for short-distance communication between a master device and one or more sub devices. SPI uses four main lines: **SCLK** (clock), **MOSI** (Master Out Sub In), **MISO** (Master In Sub Out), and **CS** (Chip Select).

#### Communication Sequence

- **CS (Chip Select)**: Communication begins when the master pulls the CS line low, selecting the sub device.
- **Master Transmission**: The master sends one or more bytes over MOSI. In this example, the master writes `0x9F`.
- **Data Response**: After receiving data, the sub device can respond by sending data back over MISO. In this sequence, the sub device responds with `0xEF`, `0x40`, and `0x14`.
- **CS High**: Communication ends when the master releases the CS line (sets it high).

#### Data Flow Example

1. **CS goes low** to select the device.
2. **Master writes** `0x9F` (command) on MOSI.
3. **Sub device responds** with `0xEF`, `0x40`, `0x41` on MISO, one bit per clock cycle.
4. **CS goes high** to end the transaction.

#### Notes

- SPI is full-duplex: data can be sent and received simultaneously.
- There is no addressing on the bus; each device is selected individually using its CS line.
- The master controls the clock and initiates all communication.

#### Bus Pirate SPI syntax

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/nor-jedecid.html" >}}

{{% alert context="info" %}}
```[0x9f r:3]``` is the Bus Pirate syntax for the SPI example above.
{{% /alert %}}

- ```[``` - CS low (active).
- ```0x9f``` - Write the command `0x9F` on MOSI.
- ```r:3``` - Read 3 bytes from MISO, which are `0xEF`, `0x40`, and `0x14`.
- ```]``` - CS high (inactive).

### ```flash``` Read/Write/Erase common flash chips

{{< asciicast src="/screencast/nor-flash-command.json" poster="npt:1:08"  idleTimeLimit=2 >}}
<br/>
The ```flash``` command can read, write, and erase common SPI flash memory chips directly in the Bus Pirate terminal. The [Serial Flash Universal Driver](https://github.com/armink/SFUD) at the heart of the flash command attempts to identify the flash chip and select the appropriate settings. Most modern flash chips contain SFDP tables that describe the chip capabilities. If a chip doesn't have SFDP tables, the driver has a database of common chips on which to fall back.

#### SPI EEPROM show protection status
{{< termfile source="static/snippets/spi-eeprom-command-protect.html" >}}
Show the write protection status of the EEPROM.
- ```eeprom protection -d <device>``` - show the protection status of the EEPROM 

##### BP1, BP0, and WPEN bits
|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|WPEN|X|X|X|BP1|BP0|WEL|WIP|

Many SPI EEPROMS have some sort of write protection configured through the status register. 25X EEPROMs generally have two block protection bits (BP1, BP0) that disable writes to a memory range. The write protection can be reversed by clearing the protection bits.

|BP1|BP0|Protected Range|
|---|---|----------------|
|0|0|No protection|
|0|1|Upper 1/4|
|1|0|Upper 1/2|
|1|1|All|

BP1 and BP0 generally protect the upper 1/4, 1/2, or all of the EEPROM. 

The WPEN bit overrides the physical write protect pin. If the WPEN bit is 0, writes are allowed even if the WP pin is held low.

{{% alert context="danger" %}}
**Sometimes write protection is irreversible**. This is pretty rare, but we've seen one or two chips with this non-standard feature that otherwise work like a normal 25X chip. This does not apply to the 25X chips from Atmel/Microchip, which all have reversible write protection, but you might find it on some rarer chips. Always consult the datasheet if possible, or just leave the protection bits alone. 
{{% /alert %}}


#### SPI EEPROM update protection bits
{{< termfile source="static/snippets/spi-eeprom-command-protect-set.html" >}}
Update the block protection bits of the EEPROM. Protected blocks cannot be written to until the protection is removed.
- ```eeprom protect -d <device> -b <bits>``` - write the block protection bits of the EEPROM. `<bits>` is a 2-bit value (BP1, BP0) and protects memory regions according to the table below. For example `-b 0b11` protects the whole EEPROM, `-b 0b01` protects the upper 1/4 of the EEPROM, and `-b 0b00` disables all protection.
- ```eeprom protect -d <device> -w <value>``` - write the Write Pin ENable (WPEN) bit. If the WPEN bit is 0, it overrides the physical write protect pin. For example, `-w 0` disables the WPEN bit, allowing writes to the EEPROM even if the pin is held high.

|BP1|BP0|Protected Range|
|---|---|----------------|
|0|0|No protection|
|0|1|Upper 1/4|
|1|0|Upper 1/2|
|1|1|All|

{{% alert context="info" %}}
Many chips support block protection bits, fewer support the WPEN bit. To test what features a chip supports, use the ```-t``` flag to proble the write protect features. 
{{% /alert %}}

#### SPI EEPROM test write protection features
{{< termfile source="static/snippets/spi-eeprom-command-protect-test.html" >}}

25X EEPROMs frequently have block protection (BP) bits that disable writes to a memory range. Newer chips also have a Write Pin ENable (WPEN) bit that overrides the physical write protect pin. To probe the write protection features we try to enable all of them, then check which were actually enabled. The command will restore the original protection settings after the test.
- ```eeprom protect -d <device> -t``` - test the write protection features of the EEPROM.

### Pull-up resistors

2-Wire is an open-collector bus, it requires pull-up resistors to hold the
clock and data lines high and create the data '1'. In 2-Wire mode, the Bus Pirate doesn't
output high, it only pulls low. Without pull-up resistors there can
never be a '1'. 

Enable the Bus Pirate onboard pull-up resistors with the [```P``` command]({{% relref "/docs/command-reference/#pp-pull-up-resistors" %}}).

{{% /alert %}}

### ```bluetag``` JTAG & SWD pinout finder

{{< asciicast src="/screencast/bluetag-jtag-demo.json" poster="npt:0:23"  idleTimeLimit=2 autoPlay=false >}}
<br/>
[blueTag](https://github.com/Aodrulez/blueTag) is an open source JTAG and SWD pin finder integrated into the Bus Pirate firmware. It can identify the JTAG/SWD pins on a target device by sending a series of test signals and analyzing the responses. 

#### Connections
- Connect the Bus Pirate IO pins to the suspected JTAG/SWD pins on the target device. 
- Start with IO0 and work your way up to IO7. 
- If possible, look for ground pours and power pins on the JTAG or SWD port and avoid connecting IO pins to them.
- Connect the Bus Pirate ground pin to the target device ground.
- Power the device.

{{% alert context="warning" %}}
Measure the target device supply/pin voltage. The Bus Pirate IO pins should set to match with the ```W``` power supply command. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert context="info" %}}
If the target has an obvious voltage out pin, then you can power the Bus Pirate IO pins from that. Attach the Bus Pirate VOUT pin to the target voltage out pin and **skip the ```W``` power supply command setup step**.
