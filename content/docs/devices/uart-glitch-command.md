The Bus Pirate can be used to trigger glitching attacks based on UART serial timing:
- Power glitching
- EMP "blasting"
- Clock glitching

For this demo, the Bus Pirate will be used to trigger a power glitching attack against an Arduino Uno.  The Arduino's software has a UART that is used to enter a password; this password will by bypassed by a power glitch.  A custom circuit on a Bus Pirate Blank Plank is used to perform the actual power glitch against the Arduino.

The Bus Pirate is used to time and trigger the "glitching" activity; actual external electrical interface to the target and/or glitching tool is required.  This may be in the form of a separte device, custom plank, breadboarding, or circuit board.

## Glitching Background
Setting up a glitching attack can be complicated and involve many factors.  The UART Glitch command is a specific type of glitch attack using UART timing to trigger the attack.  

Consider this case:
- Target device (the Arduino, in this case) has a UART interface
- This interface can access important functionality in the target, and is therefore password protected

Normal usage would be:
- User connects to the UART interface with some terminal device, for example a Bus Pirate in UART mode with the bridge command
- User is prompted to enter the password 
- User enters incorrect password and is re-prompted
- User enters correct password and gains access to the command line environment

Internally to the target, the code is most likely accepting the user's input over UART, adding each newly-entered character to a buffer and waiting for a `return` character (user hits the ENTER button).  Then the code will use some method to compare the user's entry to the "good" password to decide if the user gets access.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
From a defensive programming/security standpoint, the user should only be allowed a fixed number of failed attempts and there should be a delay after a failed attempt.  Also, the time between the user hitting ENTER and the code checking the password should not be constant; there should be variation each pass to prevent the kind of timing used in glitching.

The Arduino code used in the target for this demo does none of those things, and is in fact lifted from a very common consumer IoT device.

To try to bypass or glitch the password authentication routine, the power glitching attack will "short" the voltage to the Arduino's microcontroller for a very short period.  The duration and timing of this attack is crucial to success.

### Timing the Attack
The first step would be to use a logic analyzer to determine if the timing between the user sending a `return` on a bad password attempt and the target sending the next prompt is constant (or at least has little variation).  The easiest way to do this is to use a logic analyzer on the `TX` and `RX` lines and measuring the time:

{{% alert context="info" %}}
The Bus Pirate has a follow along logic analyzer built in that can be used for this.

In the above trace, the timing between the end of the user's input (top trace), and the target sending the prompt to try again is 29.25 microseconds.  Doing this test many times showed that this timing was pretty constant.

Knowing this, it is reasonable to guess that the password validation routine is happening some time between 10 and 20 microseconds after the user's attempt is received by the target.

The only way to know for sure is through experimentation, but the logic analyzer has narrowed the timing down.

### Attack Hardware

The Glitch command will activate Bus Pirate `IO0` during the attack; that output will turn on for a very short time when triggered.  It is implementation dependent to make use of this.  

In this case, a custom Blank Plank is used to do the power glitching.  Here is the schematic:

![](/images/docs/demo/glitch-schematic.png)  

The actual plank:  
![](/images/docs/demo/glitch-plank.png)

The way it works is that the FET will fire when the Bus Pirate triggers the glitch.  The Target (Arduino, in this case) is connected across the FET via the SMA connector.  At the Arduino side, the connection is directly across the `VCC` and `GND` pins of the AVR microcontroller.  

It is essential that the connection is as close to the microcontroller pins as possible.  For the demo, the connection was made directly to the MCU pins:  
![](/images/docs/demo/glitch-target.png)  

### Glitching Attack Sequence
In operation, the glitching attack sequence goes like this:
- Wait for the glitch ready input `IO1`.  This allows external devices to be ready; this step can be disabled by configuration if not necessary.  For example, if doing EMP blast glitching, it may be necessary to wait for the EMP device to be ready
- Send the "password enter" character from Bus Pirate to target over UART.  This is configurable, typically a `return` or `newline` character
- Wait for a configured delay.  This is time is based on the timing obtained from the logic analyzer
- Turn on the glitch trigger output `IO0`.  Leave the output on for the configured time, then turn it back off.  This is typically a very short time when power glitching
- Read the UART characters comming back from the target.  Parse the return string, looking for a particualy character as an indication of success.  For example, if the target responds with "Please enter password", the presense of the the letter "P" is an indication the glitch failed.  This character is configurable.
- Wait an additional delay to allow components to cool, EMP blaster to recharge, etc.
- If the glitch did not succeed, start at the beginning.

## Setup
The configuration can be set based on the approximate timing from the logic analyzer trace:  
{{< termfile source="static/snippets/glitch-setup.html" >}}
- use the `m` command to select `uart` mode 
- configure UART to match the target's UART baudrate, character size, etc.  
- use the `glitch` command to configure or start glitching:
  -  `Glitch trigger character` - this is the ASCII value of the character to send to the target to begin the process.  Typically character 13, the `return` character
  - `Glitch trigger delay` - the amount of time after the end of the sending the trigger character before turning on the glitch output. This value is in terms of nanoseconds * 10; so an entry of 1400 is 14,000 nanoseconds or 14 microseconds
  - `Glitch vary time` - this allows some variation on timing.  If the value is 3, the first glitch delay will be 14.00 microseconds, then the next at 14.03 microseconds, 14.06, etc. for 5 sequences.  The the glitch time will reset to the `Glitch trigger delay`
  - `Glitch output on time` - how long to turn the output on.  This is also in nanoseconds * 10, so a value of 7 is 70 nanoseconds, .070 microseconds. 
  - `Glitch cycle delay` - a fixed amount of time to wait between cycles; this value is in milliseconds
  - `Normal response character` - the ASCII value of a character that would normally be seen if the target did *not* glitch; what the user would normally see if the password entered was not correct.  If the target responds with "Please enter password" for a bad password attempt, a good value would be `P` - ASCII 80
  - `Number of glitch attempts` - the number of tries before giving up.  Note that the actual number of attemps will be 5 times this number, allowing for glitch time variation
  - `Bypass 'READY' input checking` - by default, the glitcher will wait until input `IO1` is "high" before starting each glitch sequence.  This is used to make sure the glitching hardware is ready.  If there is no need to check for "ready", set this value to `1` to disable the check.

## Perform the Glitch Attack
Start by enabling UART mode, the using the `bridge` command to verify communications:  
{{< termfile source="static/snippets/glitch-step1.html" >}}  
The `bridge` command shows that the target is accepting passwords, and returns `### Please enter password ###` when the wrong password is entered.  Use the Bus Pirate button to exit bridge mode.

Next, enter the `glitch` command, configure it, and it will begin running:  
{{< termfile source="static/snippets/glitch-step2.html" >}}    
It appears the glitch was successful on the second attempt.  Instead of returning `### Please enter password ###` over the UART, the target returned `$>`.

As a final verification, use the `bridge` command again to explore the changes in the UART connection:  
{{< termfile source="static/snippets/glitch-step3.html" >}}    

The Arduino code in the target just provides this basic interface; of course a "real" target could have much more functionality.

## Final Notes
Glitching attacks are notoriously difficult.  It takes many, many attempts to get the timing correct, and even then may not be very repeatable.  The glitch command in the Bus Pirate is a useful learning tool to begin to experiment with the concept and process of glitching.  It should be flexible enough to be used on a variety of targets. 

The Arduino code for the example target is fairly simplistic, and is full of bad coding and poor security practice.  As noted above, this code was lifted almost exactly from a popular consumer IoT device and is similar to what might be found in the wild.
